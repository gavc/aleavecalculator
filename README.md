a leave calculator including public holidays

REC/SCK - Skips weekends and public holidays in calculations

LSL - Includes weekends and public holidays in calculations and at 1/2 pay will calculate a public holiday as a full day.

Should give you the best option to choose either REC first or LSL first to get the most out of your leave.

Holiday data currently covers 2025-01-01 to 2035-12-26 (includes the Ekka Peoples Day "Show" holiday).
The calculator now enforces this range in the date picker and will warn if a manual date is outside coverage.
